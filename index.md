Join me on an expedition to the Kingdom of Linguistics. On our expedition, we will discover many intruiging facts about the Kingdom, how it
has changed over time, and its relation to other kingdoms in the world of Scientifical thinking.<br/>

<h1>Section 1: Geography.</h1>
<p>The Kingdom of Linguistics is divided into two states, Synchronic and Diachronic, each of which is divided into five regions: 
<ul> <li> The mountains of syntactics,</li>
     <li> The plains of semantics, and</li>
     <li> The metropolitans of phenomics, which are surrounded by</li>
     <li> The forest of phonetics.</li>
</ul>
